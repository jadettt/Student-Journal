## Wednesday Session - Research Effectivly
- What is a method you use/used to help you research effectively? ( use this link to go over our slides from that day https://www.canva.com/design/DAD0yasIplc/M9LfksTwl9Ze0waJTwUEZw/view?utm_content=DAD0yasIplc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink )

- If not, what is a method you want to start using? why?
I want to become more understanding and confident with data research because I've always found it hard to understand research taken with data and using all those similar methods so becoming more common with it would boost my knowledge and confidence with that specific research method/option. 
- Do you think researching is important? why?
Reseraching is very important and helpful because in most situations you need research to understand the situation better and move forward, without those components it'd be very hard to progress forward with a outcome.
